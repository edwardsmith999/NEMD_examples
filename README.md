# Non Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) examples

This repository is a community effort to collect example cases to help new researchers get started in non equilibrium molecular dynamics.
This should include input files for open-source codes, both from simple teaching examples and newly published papers which include the input files. Initially this is a series of links to examples but could extend to include input files here.

To add new cases, please edit this README.md and submit a pull request or email to edward.smith@brunel.ac.uk

LAMMPS cases
-------------

For LAMMPS, start with the examples here: 

https://docs.lammps.org/Examples.html

The NIST are good for equilibrium parameterisation:

Online tutorials are given here:

From the [Bresme's group](https://github.com/bresmegroup)

Code to generate nanoparticle cases

Code to integrate LAMMPS chunks

https://github.com/bresmegroup/IntegrateProfile

GROMACs cases
-------------

Code to simulate the BK3 water model from the [Sega group](https://github.com/Marcello-Sega)

PLUMED case
-----------

The CmuMD method, which allows to mimic open boundary conditions in NVT molecular simulations involving solid/fluid interfaces, and enables the simulation of concentration-driven fluxes through porous membranes.

General NEMD Tools
------------------

Pytim is a cross platform tool to identify liquid-vapour interfaces in MD simulation written by the [Sega group](https://github.com/Marcello-Sega).

Specific paper examples
------------------------
Here any published paper on NEMD which has input files can be added:

  - Rahman et al (2024) on film rupture has all input files available: https://github.com/MuhammadRRahman/Thin-Film-Rupture-NEMD for use in open source software [Flowmol](https://github.com/edwardsmith999/flowmol) along with all post processing to generate the manuscript figures. 

This NEMD website aims to collect these examples.
